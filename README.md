# wc-python
Linux wc tool clone written in python

This tool was written as per guidance within John Cricketts Weekly Coding Challenges. The initial scope of this project includes the features defined within his challenge. Beyond the MVP I'll look to add more complex features which exist in the actual WC tool.
